# ram-clean.sh readme 

As much as I love the Mac OSX operating system, it does seem to have an issue with memory management. To help solve the problem of constantly running out of memory and the OS not cleaning I created a script that would free as much memory as possible without a reboot. 

Put this in your home directory and then run "./ram-clean.sh" and wait. Once it is done you will notice you have a ton more free memory. 

Note: This does not seem to be needed as much in Mavericks
